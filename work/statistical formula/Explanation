For each gender graph of male and female, mean, median and mode are basci statistic measurements as the three central tendency measurements for providing the insight of the distribution of the data
using mean, known as average, to present the summary of the values in the dataset with the cooporation with extreme values and helpful for the symmetric distributions for the no outliers even for the normal distribution like this.
Both median and mode are for arranging the order that help to present the central value where better for the skewered dsitrbutions.
Mean, median, and mode are used in statistics to summarize and describe the central tendency of a dataset. The choice of which measure to use depends on the distribution of the data, the presence of outliers, and the specific goals of the analysis.
For standard deviation, using for measuring and presenting the variability of the data set in the values as the measure of variablitiy and data analysis to understand the better.
Using t-test for determining the significant differences between two comparison groups, particularly, normal distributions, for example if you see the male and female, you will see the not sigifnicantly differences between two graphs
which only compare like 0.3
